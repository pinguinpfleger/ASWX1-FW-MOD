# ASWX1-FW-MOD  
**Artillery Sidewinder X1 Firmware Mod**  
   
The ASWX1-FW-Mod is an optimization for the Artillery Sidewinder X1 3D printer.  
The Artillery Sidewinder X1 is delivered with [Marlin 1.19](http://www.artillery3d.com/DownLoad/15688.html) and deactivated EEPROM memory function (M500).  
  
This optimized firmware is based on [Marlin Firmware Version 2.0.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/2.0.x)  
and on Marlin [Artillery Sidewinder X1 config](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/master/config/examples/Artillery/Sidewinder%20X1)  

There is also an [optimized firmware for Artillery Sidewinder X1 touch display](https://github.com/pinguinpfleger/ASWX1-TFTFW-MOD) which you can install too but it is optionally.  

## Releases  
  29.02.2020 [ASWX1-FW-MOD-v1.0](https://github.com/pinguinpfleger/ASWX1-FW-MOD/releases/tag/ASWX1-FW-MOD-v1.0) - [ASWX1-FW-MOD-v1.0.zip](https://github.com/pinguinpfleger/ASWX1-FW-MOD/releases/download/ASWX1-FW-MOD-v1.0/ASWX1-FW-MOD-v1.0.zip)  based on Marlin 2.0.4.4
  
## Improvements  

1. **Save to EEPROM**  
   Enabled EEPROM `M500` to persist settings.  
   Now you can store PIDs and Z-Offsets to EEPROM  

2. **LIN_ADVANCE activated**  
    Linear Advance brings you better dimensional precision due to reduced bleeding edges.  
    Higher printing speeds are possible without any loss of print quality - as long as your extruder can handle the needed speed changes.  
    Visible and tangible print quality is increased even at lower printing speeds.  
    No need for high acceleration and jerk values to get sharp edges.  
   Read https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html for more details and how to calibrate.  
   By default the K_Factor is set to 0, so it is disabled.  
   To enable it using gcode you should first [calibrate your specific K factor](https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html). 
   Accordingly set the K factor within your slicer using e.g. `M900 K0.2`  

4. **S_CURVE_ACCELERATION activated**  
   This option eliminates vibration during printing by fitting a BÃ©zier curve to move acceleration, producing much smoother direction changes.  
  
5. **ADAPTIVE_STEP_SMOOTHING activated**  
    Adaptive Step Smoothing increases the resolution of multi-axis moves, particularly at step frequencies below 1kHz (for AVR) or 10kHz (for ARM), where aliasing between axes in multi-axis moves causes audible vibration and surface artifacts.
    The algorithm adapts to provide the best possible step smoothing at the lowest stepping frequencies.  
    

## Individual adjustments  
Individual adjustments can be made in [Configuration.h](/Marlin/Configuration.h) and [Configuration_adv.h](/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h)  
[Read more about configuring Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/configuration.html)  
Of course the firmware must be recompiled than.  
There are serveral ways to compile.

\[Linux / Mac\]  
An easy one do compile is [platformio CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation-methods) command.  
To complile you just need execute `platformio run` in the root folder of this repository (where platformio.ini is also located).  
The new compiled firmware is saved here: .pio/build/megaatmega2560/firmware.hex

\[Windows\]  
There is a great instruction how to [use Arduino-IDE on Marlin.org](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html).
This should be the easiest way on Windows.

Bord: "Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560"  
Processor: "ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)"

Customize your configs, use "Sketchs -> Export compiled Binary", flash it, have fun :)


## Flashing  
**Important**: Don't forget to read and backup your current EEPROM-settings with `M503`!!!

The display and the USB-Port are sharing the same wires so flashing the motherboard-firmware need some extra work.  
There are two ways possible to flash the firmware.  
  
### 1. Disconnect the display  
You have to open the printer and unplug the display.  
  
### 2. Loop method  
With this method we try to talk to the motherboard before the display is ready to listen.  
The [flash.sh](/flash.sh) script is trying to flash the command in a loop until the command finishs succesfully.

E.g. this works fine with an Octopi and SSH-connection like [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/).
To get your Firmware-File onto the octopi while using a Windows-mashine you can use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/).

Steps:  
- Make sure Artillery Sidewinder X1 is unplugged from the power supply.  
- Unplug USB Cable too.  
- Connect your Linux box (or Mac) with the printer USB-Port.
- \[Linux\]:Install AVRDude by `sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get install avr-dude`  
- \[Mac\]: Install AVRDude by `brew install avrdude`  
- Place firmware.hex and flash.sh on your Linux box (or Mac) and execute flash.sh.
- Enter Path and filename (e.g. `./firmware.hex`)
- You will see timeout errors - thats normal.  
- Plug USB Cable  
- Leave flash.sh running and unplug / plug USB Cable or hit the reset button until the flash.sh finishs. <br> This could take several trys, no panic.
  
  
### Reset to factory defaults
I recommend to reset the newly flashed firmware to its defaults and overwrite any older settings.  

**Important:** Don't forget to **read your settings by `M503` and copy/save them** somewhere before you start flashing the Firmware.  

The gcode command to reset the firmware to the hardcoded defaults is `M502`,  
followed by `M500` to save these default setting to EEPROM.  
After that you can restore your settings from your `M503`-Backup (e.g. `M92 X80.12 Y80.12 Z399.78 E420.00`)  
Save again by `M500` and finally reload all stored data from EEPROM by `M501`  

You can execute the gcode commands using a terminal program like Arduino-IDE, [Pronterface](https://www.pronterface.com/) or using the Terminal Tab in Octoprint.
